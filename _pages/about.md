I'm an AI Resident at AI4Bharat, Indian Institute of Technology Madras. Currently I work with Prof.the Speech Synthesis team for developing natural, human-level speech synthesis systems for the Indian subcontinent. My interests broady lie in speech synthesis, multi-modal models and their evaluation.

Prior to this, I worked as an intern at Saama Technologies Pvt Ltd where I dabbled in multiple roles like backend developer, data engineer, etc. occasionaly tweaking front-end logic too. My experience encompasses backend API development, utilizing Transformer encoder models for question answering, database management, data engineering.

Currently, I'm working to tackle problems in long-form speech synthesis where, for particularly long sentences like paragraphs, inconsistencies with pitch are common. I'm also developing a speech processing toolkit particularly focussed on the Indic languages. My previous research experience lies in developing TTS systems in extremely resource constrained scenarios and expressive speech synthesis.
