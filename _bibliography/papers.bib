abstract="Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) is the process where computers or, machines are taught to understand a paragraph or more technically called a context. Like humans, machines also need to be evaluated for their understanding on question answering. MRC is one of the formidable sub-domains in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) domain, which has seen considerable progress over the years. In recent years, many novel datasets have tried to challenge the Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) models with inference based question answering. With the advancement in NLP, many models have surpassed human-level performance on these datasets, albeit ignoring the obvious disparity between genuine human-level performance and state-of-the-art performance. This highlights the need for attention on the collective improvement of existing datasets, metrics, and models towards ``real'' prehension. Addressing the lack of sanity in the domain, this paper performs a comparative study on various transformer based models and tries to highlight the success factors of each model. Subsequently, we discuss an MRC model that performs comparatively better, if not the best, on question answering and give directions for future research.",
